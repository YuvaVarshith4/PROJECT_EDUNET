Image Steganography in Python

Overview This project demonstrates an Image Steganography tool implemented in Python, allowing users to embed secret messages within images for secure communication. The application features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that enables users to easily encrypt and decrypt hidden messages within image files using a passcode for added security. This project is an excellent example of how Python can be used for image manipulation and data security.

Features Encrypt and Decrypt Messages: Hide and retrieve secret messages inside images. GUI Interface: Simple and user-friendly interface built with Tkinter. Passcode Protection: Secure encryption and decryption using a passcode. Cross-Platform Support: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Image File Support: Works with standard image formats like PNG and JPG. Real-Time Status Updates: Displays status messages during the encryption and decryption process. Technology Used Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

Tkinter (for GUI) Pillow (PIL) (for image processing) NumPy (for advanced image manipulation) Cryptography (for additional security, if implemented) OS and File Handling (for file operations) Platform Compatibility: Windows, macOS, Linux Opencv

Development Environment: VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook Usage

Encrypt a Message: Select an image using the Select Image button.

Enter your secret message and passcode.

Click Encrypt to hide the message inside the image.

Decrypt a Message: Select the encrypted image.

Enter the passcode used during encryption.

Click Decrypt to retrieve the hidden message.
